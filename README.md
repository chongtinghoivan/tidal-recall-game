## 🌊 The Game
In **Tidal Recall**, you are a treasure hunter exploring the sea floor. Every round, a new item washes ashore. Your mission is simple but challenging: 
**Always pick the treasure that has just appeared.** 

As your collection grows, the board shuffles, testing your ability to distinguish the new from the familiar.

### Key Features
- **Progressive Difficulty**: The board expands dynamically from a 2x2 grid up to a 6x6 treasury.
- **30 Unique Treasures**: Hand-picked ocean icons with individual color themes.
- **Pure Logic**: Implements the Fisher-Yates algorithm for unbiased shuffling.
- **Privacy First**: 100% local execution. No APIs, no tracking, and no external data calls.
- **Pirate Feedback**: Enjoy whimsical, local-only commentary from the Captain based on your score.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **React 19**: Modern functional components for state-driven UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for a responsive, immersive atmosphere.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Aside from the core React libraries, the game is entirely self-contained.

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Click **Start Expedition**.
2. One treasure will appear. Click it!
3. Next round, a new treasure appears alongside the previous ones.
4. **Identify and click the new treasure.**
